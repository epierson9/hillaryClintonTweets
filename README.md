# hillaryClintonTweets

This contains the numbers underlying the analysis of the Twitter hashtag <a href = https://twitter.com/search?q=wordsthatdontdescribehillary&src=typd>WordsThatDontDescribeHillary</a>, a compilation of criticisms of Hillary Clinton. See the IPython notebook for our analysis of more than 12,000 tweets. You will not be able to run the code yourself because Twitter does not allow us to make the data public and the code relies on internal libraries, but please contact emmap1@cs.stanford.edu if anything is unclear or you would like the data for your own purposes. 

Analysis performed by <a href = http://maryknugent.com/>Mary Nugent</a> and <a href = http://cs.stanford.edu/~emmap1/>Emma Pierson</a>.
